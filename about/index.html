&ldquo;About&rdquo; section from his website<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, as I too intend to write on similar
topics, and I have found his words to cover the things I want to say in a beautiful way. I have
edited the <em>About text formatting</em> section a bit as I do like to use the italics, bold and quotes
wherever required. I have also added some sections from the &ldquo;Fundamental duties&rdquo; section from the
Indian constitution.</p><hr><p>Welcome to my blog. Most posts here are aimed at general public, but I will also write a number of
semi-technical posts aimed at people interested in computer programming.</p><p>I write here on topics I like, from areas of my interest. These mainly include education,
philosophy, science, technology, religion, spirituality – and how these artifacts affect human life
on individual and societal levels.</p><h2 id=a-welcome-warning>A welcome warning!</h2><p>Sorry but I think this is required. The blogposts here do mostly raise questions and you as a reader
are expected to answer them for yourself. They may occasionally represent some of my ideas and may
contain some of my opinions.</p><p>I believe in freedom of speech and liberal humanism. I do not demand you to respect my opinions, you
are more than welcome to criticize my ideas/opinions. I expect you also to not demand me or anyone
else to respect the ideas that you find worthy of respect. I request you to evaluate ideas for
yourself without following anyone blindly and come to your own conclusions.</p><p>Most of my non-technical posts would be focusing on the topics stated as the fundamental duties
of every Indian citizen<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>:</p><blockquote><p>It shall be the duty(fundamental) of every citizen of India to develop the scientific temper,
humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform.</p></blockquote><p>As pointed out by a great thinker Dr. Ambedkar one must criticize the ideas they find unacceptable
but not attack the people. He criticized and attacked the ideas embodied in what one might call
“Brahmanism” but he was strictly against attacking people who happened to be born in that caste.</p><p>So if you are a devout bhakt [a devotee] or a believer or a comrade of some
idea/ideology/religion/atheism who cannot tolerate any criticism of the ideas/ideology that you
follow then this blog is not for you. You may not find things written here interesting. On the
other hand, if you are a critical thinker and open minded person, I hope there is something of
interest for you in here.</p><p>I like to draw your attention to this debate that happened on BBC, in which Mr. Maajid Nawaz, a
liberal humanist Muslim thinker who was an extremist earlier, talks about this issue<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>.</p><h2 id=about-text-formatting>About text formatting</h2><p>Dijkstra has famously said [not in exactly these words], “I do not highlight parts of what I write
as I write only those things that I consider to be important.” Dijkstra was a great thinker and a
gifted writer, who could express his ideas very excellently and in a very concise manner. I do
know that I stand very low in these abilities as compared to him but I try my best.</p><p>I’d like to draw your attention to another great thinker, Pascal, in this context.</p><blockquote><p>I have only made this letter longer because I have not had the(enough) time to make it shorter.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, it is very difficult to express your ideas in short and concise form. So, if you
find me more verbose than what you consider to be ideal/optimal, I request you to bear with me.</p><p>Another thing, I do not like inline hyperlinks within an article/post as I find them
distracting. Almost all references and links will be provided at the end of the post as
footnotes. For example, see at the end of this about blog post.</p><p>Lastly, these blogposts are mostly written for personal education and hence I do not bother myself
too much to provide references in a rigorous way, like you would find in a high quality academic
journal. Having said so, I do strive hard to give references and internet links wherever I feel
them necessary and/or to be adding value.</p><h2 id=comment-policy>Comment Policy</h2><p>I would like to quote Maajid Nawaz on the comment policy:</p><blockquote><p>No idea is above scrutiny and no people are beneath dignity.
&ndash; Majid Nawaz</p></blockquote><p>I adhere to some(arbitrary) standard of comment quality that I like. It’s pretty liberal, and you
are allowed to put comments critical of my opinions. I expect the criticism to be positive and by
that I mean, the criticism must be directed towards ideas and not be a personal attack per se, I
hope you are aware of various logical fallacies. If not, you may start by looking at the
<em>argumentum ad hominem</em> attack<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> fallacy. See logical fallacies<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> also.</p><p>I finish by quoting Socrates:</p><blockquote><p>Strong minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, weak minds discuss people.</p></blockquote><p>Do share it with your friends and your feedback is most welcome.</p><p>[swananddhawan gmail]</p><p>That’s all!
